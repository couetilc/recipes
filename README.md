## Awesome Tomato Sauce with Meatballs

Meatballs:
- 1lb. of ground beef
- .5cup of seasoned bread crumbs, moistened with 1-3tbsp of water or milk (I used 4C bread crumbs seasoned with pecorino romano cheese)
- pinch of salt
- lots of fresh ground pepper
- 2-5 crushed garlic cloves
- 1 egg
- (optional) 1/4cup of grated parmesan

Sauce:
- 1/3 cup of Mezcal (or sake? can experiment with liquors here, not a big fan of white wine unless it's amazing) to deglaze
- 15oz can of tomato sauce 
- .5tsp of italian seasoning
- pinch of salt
- lots of fresh ground pepper
- 5 crushed garlic cloves
- (optional) bay leaf

1. Brown meatballs in pan or pot.
2. set meatballs aside once brown.
3. deglaze pan with mezcal.
4. pour tomato sauce into pan.
5. stir then put italian seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic, and bay leaf into sauce.
6. bring up to simmer.
7. place meatballs back into pan, cover with sauce.
8. cook for about 15min more until meatballs are up to temperature.

Goes well with 1cup of boiled pasta and grated parmesan cheese for a meal for
two with leftover meatballs.
